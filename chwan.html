			Chwan Games
			</h2>
			
			<p>
			Over the summer a group of my friends and I decided to  design and create a website with mini-games that we planned to make.
			My part in the team project was to lead the design work. Even though we never did end up finishing the site it was a good learning 
			experience and a humbling one at that. From this project I got to see that design is not only hardwork but work that requires a lot of teamwork.
			If I were to design this site again I would like to have more user input because I realized we took a very vain approach and simply designed for ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
			For this project I decided to go with a flat style design since it was a fun and trendy style at the time and one that I was comfortable with implementing.
			Below are just some of the prototypes and character designs I had in mind.
