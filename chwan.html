	<h3>Why we started this project</h3>
	<p>
	Over the summer a group of my friends and I decided to design and create a website with mini-games 
	that we planned to make. My part in the team project was to lead the design work. Even though we never 
	did end up finishing the site it was a good learning experience and a humbling one at that. From this
	project I got to see that design is not only handwork but work that requires a lot of teamwork. If 
	I were to design this site again I would like to have more user input because I realized we took a 
	very vain approach and simply designed for ourselves.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Target Audience </h3>
	<p>
	Our target audience for this app were kids and adults who enjoy phone games. Unfortunately we did not get to 
	interview any body for this project to get user research.
	</p>
	
	<h3> The Result </h3>
	<p>
	Ultimately, we did not finish this project. Even though this failure was deemed a failure I learned a lot.
	For this project we jumped into production way too quickly without even thinking about design. We were all too focused
	on making a tangible game that we did not even organize our roles, the team's core values, and project management. This lack of
	communication and willingness to step up as a leader ultimately lead to a slow dwindle for team Chwan. Although we all had passion to 
	start once that ran out it was decline from their. The biggest take away I got from this was that as a designer I have responsibility to 
	not only manage the product and make a clear plan but to make sure everyone is on board and held accountable.
